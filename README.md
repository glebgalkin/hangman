# Hangman
## Overview
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters one at a time. The player attempting to guess the word has a limited number of attempts (represented by the "hangman" figure), and the goal is to guess the word correctly before running out of attempts.
